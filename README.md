## Overview

ExplicaAI is an offline mathematics education application specifically designed for Brazilian public schools, built to operate completely offline using Google's Gemma 3n model. The system provides step-by-step problem solving, collection management for study organization, and advanced pedagogical features.

## Problem Statement

Many Brazilian public schools have computer labs with limited or unstable internet connectivity. Mathematics teachers need digital tools that function offline while providing educational explanations to support the teaching-learning process.

## Installation and Setup

### Complete Installation Guide

For detailed step-by-step installation instructions, including troubleshooting and school environment configuration, see:

**ðŸ“– [install_guide.md](./install_guide.md) - Complete Installation Guide**

### Quick Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd explicaai

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize database
npm run init-db

# Start Ollama service (separate terminal)
ollama serve

# Start backend (terminal 2)
npm start

# Start frontend (terminal 3)
cd front
npm run dev
```
## Development Structure

ExplicaAI follows a monorepo structure:
explicaai/
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js              # Backend entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json           # Backend dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/                # API routes
â”œâ”€â”€ services/              # Backend services
â”œâ”€â”€ front/                 # Frontend application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       # Frontend dependencies
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # React components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ public/            # Static assets
â””â”€â”€ database/              # SQLite database

**Running the application requires three terminals:**
1. **Ollama Service:** `ollama serve`
2. **Backend API:** `npm start` (root folder)
3. **Frontend:** `npm run dev` (front folder)

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
2. **Ollama** installed and configured
3. **Gemma 3n model** downloaded via Ollama

### Installation Verification

1. Access `http://localhost:3000`
2. Verify the application detects Ollama online
3. Test with simple problem: "2 + 2"

## Application Usage

### For Teachers

1. **Lesson Preparation:** Create thematic collections with specific problems
2. **Demonstration:** Use the system to explain concepts in real-time
3. **Exercises:** Generate similar problems for student practice

### For Students

1. **Guided Resolution:** Input problems and follow step-by-step solutions
2. **Directed Study:** Access collections organized by topic
3. **Practice:** Request generation of similar exercises
4. **Review:** Consult history of solved problems

## Technical Differentials

### Intelligent Complexity Detection

A system was implemented that analyzes mathematical problems and determines the resolution approach:

- **Simple Problems:** Basic operations solved in 1-2 direct steps
- **Medium Problems:** Equations and calculations requiring 3-6 steps
- **Complex Problems:** Advanced concepts with 5-10 detailed steps

### Validation and Retry System

Quality mechanism implementation that:
- Validates structured response format
- Executes automatic retry with stricter prompts
- Provides fallback in case of persistent failures

### Gemma 3n Optimization

The application was specifically optimized for the Gemma 3n model:
- Prompts adjusted for model characteristics
- Temperature parameters configured for mathematics
- Specific handling of multimodal responses
